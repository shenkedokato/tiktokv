00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,806
Hey, what's up everyone? My name is Tim. In this video I'm gonna explain how

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,738
you can easily convert audio, so let's say a voice recording or a podcast

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:11,246
to subtitles. And as a bonus, at the end of the video I'm showing you

4
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:15,274
how you can use one of our templates and make amazing videos with subtitles

5
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:18,698
with one of our templates. So stay tuned. So in this video we're

6
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:22,030
to use VEED's online video editor and you can instantly get started.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,198
Simply head over to your browser and type in the URL box, edit new

8
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:29,650
and click on Enter. You can also click on the first link in the description.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,170
Now we're in V's editor and we can get started. You can upload an audio

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,726
or video file if you like. You can choose one of the templates, but for

11
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:39,894
now I'm just going to convert audio to subtitles. So I'm going to click on

12
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:43,798
upload a file, select the audio file I want to convert to subtitles

13
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,146
and click on open again. We're prompted to choose a template or

14
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:50,366
a dimension, but I just want to start with a blank canvas. So I'm going

15
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:54,218
to click on start with a blank canvas and as you can see. Hey everyone,

16
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,386
my name is Tim. I just wanted to say a quick hi to. The audio

17
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:01,146
file is imported, so now I want to turn this audio fragment to subtitles

18
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:04,746
and we're going to use VEED's automatic transcription tool. So to get started it's

19
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:08,578
very easy. Head over to subtitles in the left menu and then choose one of

20
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:12,386
the subtitle options. You can choose to add subtitles manually or

21
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:15,406
you can choose the auto subtitle tool. In this case we're going to choose auto

22
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,770
subtitle. Now we're prompted to choose the language we spoke in our video.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,958
And as you can see there's a lot of languages you can choose from.

24
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,634
In this case, I chose to speak English, so I can only do two languages

25
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,854
anyway. So I'm going to select English and then click

26
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,306
on start. And now the auto transcription tool will automatically transcribe

27
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:35,718
the audio to text and turn them into subtitles. And as you

28
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:39,414
can see we converted audio to subtitles and we can watch it back.

29
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:42,366
I just wanted to say a quick hi to everyone and I hope you're all

30
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:45,774
doing well. Nice. In a bit I'm going to download these subtitles as

31
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:48,958
a text file and an SRT file. But first I want to show you how

32
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:52,174
you can edit these subtitles. So on the left you can see all the text

33
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,806
boxes, they're all synced with the video itself as you can also see in

34
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,010
the bottom timeline. But let's say you want to change the text,

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,202
you can just simply click on the text itself and just change whatever

36
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,898
you like. Because we use the auto transcription tool, it's already very accurate so I

37
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:09,638
don't need to change much. But let's say you want to change the timing of

38
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:13,586
the subtitles. Simply head over to the bottom timeline and you can click and drag

39
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:17,318
on one of the sides. Or just simply click from the middle and just

40
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,742
move it around. As you can see on the bottom timeline you can also add

41
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:24,394
subtitles or you can split subtitles. For instance if you're going to use

42
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,878
the play ad in the bottom timeline and just let it rest somewhere. And we're

43
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:31,462
going to click on split subtitle and then split the subtitle Tada

44
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,086
into. So that's how you edit your subtitles. So if you want to download your

45
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:38,650
subtitles as a text file, srt file or vtt file,

46
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,154
simply head over to options in the subtitles menu. And on the download

47
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:45,998
subtitles you can choose one of the formats, SRT, VTT or text.

48
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,946
In this case I'm going to choose SRT and I'm going to click on the

49
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,210
download button and I also want to download a text file from it. So again,

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,586
just choose the format, click on text format and click on the

51
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,086
download button. Now if we take a look in our downloads

52
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:02,438
folder, you can see the SRT file and the text file. We can open a

53
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:06,134
text file for instance. And as you can see all the transcriptions are in there.

54
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,374
Now let's say you want to do more. Let's say you want to turn this

55
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:11,494
audio fragment into a video with subtitles in there.

56
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,346
We simply go back to the beginning. You can choose one of the templates for

57
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:17,962
instance. And once you chose one of the templates, you can easily change any

58
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,306
element that you can see in the video frame. And as I showed you

59
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:24,766
before, you can easily use the auto transcription tool to turn the audio to

60
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,346
subtitles again. And now with the help of Vit's editor, you can edit the audio

61
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,982
visualizers, the text, the subtitles. You can customize them,

62
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,758
design them, you can change the background, add images, add music,

63
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:39,022
whatever you like. And then if you did all that,

64
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,286
just simply click on the export button in the right top corner and make

65
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,826
sure burn subtitles is enabled because that's what makes the subtitles

66
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,494
burned into the video. And then when the video is rendered you're free to choose

67
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:52,886
to share your video with your friends, colleagues or family. All right?

68
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,454
And that's how you convert audio to subtitles. Thank you so much for watching.

69
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,520
Good luck and have a nice day.
